# rocale-cli

A command-line tool for building, uploading, and running Roblox projects via Roblox's [Open Cloud APIs for Luau Execution](https://create.roblox.com/docs/cloud/reference/features/luau-execution).

## Usage

The tool can be installed as a dependency to your project using foreman. Simply add this line to your `foreman.toml`.
```
rocale-cli = { source = "Roblox/rocale-cli", version = "0.1.0" }
```

You can also manually grab a release from the [releases](https://github.com/Roblox/rocale-cli/releases) page.

Run `rocale-cli help` to see available commands and run `rocale-cli <command> --help` for more information on how to use each command.

## rocale-cli run

To spawn an OCALE task and use `rocale-cli run`, you will need to [create a new place](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/creations) and generate an [Open Cloud API Key](https://create.roblox.com/dashboard/credentials). Your key will need the following permissions to your place:

- `universe-places:write`
- `luau-execution-sessions:write`

```

## Building

First, run `foreman install` to install dependencies.

To build, run `lute scripts/build`. The build artifacts will be created in the `build` directory.

To build for release, run `lute scripts/build <version> $(git rev-parse HEAD)` to bake the version and commit hash of the build into the binary.

To run tests, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests).
